      Look at Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pier Paolo Piccioli, so ascetic and spare
      with their dark clothes and modest demeanor, and you can only wonder at
      the intensity of the clothes they create. So, obviously, did the scribe
      who penned their show notes, as lost in the search for words to define the
      collection as everyone else was after the fact. That's because Chiuri and
      Piccioli are like the solitary writer who spins a magic kingdom out of his
      imagination. "Regal beauty," Piccioli said by way of explanation. "Sensual
      but severe." And if that had a Game of Thrones tang, well, that fitted
      with a Couture collection that felt like a world we were allowed to enter
      without fully understanding what it was we were seeing. The mood board in
      their studio was dense with nineteenth century altered states: the
      symbolists, the decadents, a romantic spirit that combined ecstatic
      release and exhausted lassitude. Valentino is a house that traditionally
      reads red, but Chiuri and Piccioli dialed down to blue, introspection and
      reflection versus the extrovert essence of house habit. It made for a
      quietly spectacular opening in crepes, chiffons, and cashmeres with a lush
      sobriety. That same idea of modest luxury carried over into a full-length
      lace and chiffon floral dress, and a coat that was encrusted with cashmere
      appliqués of flowers and leaves in a pattern that was inspired by William
      Morris' Tree of Life. It was so ludicrously vivid that you could imagine
      the old boy himself would have felt one step closer to God when he looked
      at it. If there have been times in Chiuri and Piccioli's tenure at
      Valentino when they seemed a little stultified by respectful politeness,
      today felt like a once-and-for-all cutting loose. The way they introduced
      brocade, for instance, an oldish idea, but here zapped with yellow. Then
      there was the blue, of course, antithesis of all the house traditionally
      holds dear, even if the red did reinsert itself toward the end of the show
      (which only created a pleasurable tension for Spring). One of the most
      memorable outfits from this Couture moment in Paris will surely be the
      evening dress in navy plissé with the black shadow falling diagonally
      across it. Stark lushness—why does that notion sound so right with Couture
      in such transition?
