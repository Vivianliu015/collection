      Guo Pei described this collection as “an alternate universe,” which may or
      may not have represented the afterlife. A sandy runway was decorated with
      an arch of entwined black branches populated by black crows suggesting a
      macabre portal into her imagination. “When I was a child, I often thought
      about death,” the couturier said through a translator. “Where do we go? I
      think a lot of people think about this.” From the opening dress, with its
      two-for-one Marie Antoinette pannier skirt inhabited by ghostly twins, to
      the penultimate gown that turned the model into a glamorous mummy, these
      were otherworldly, largely colorless creations destined for the most
      high-ranking souls (whose diversity, it should be noted, was questionably
      lacking). Among the more classical garments were ecclesiastical robes,
      weightless Renaissance dresses, Elizabethan ruffs, 1950s cocktail frocks,
      and a corseted kimono dress. But there was also a bird’s-nest look with a
      view to the incubating eggs; a dress that featured a bloodred heart from
      which branches and flowers projected outward like an overgrowth of
      arteries and veins; and a 17th-century crinoline staged with preciously
      outfitted miniature dolls. For potential clients, meanwhile, there were
      several designs—the graphic feathered bodysuit or a romantic 18th-century
      dress, say—that could have lives after the runway. In using a type of hemp
      made from pineapple leaves, Pei elevated an earthy textile into a sublime
      material that, at times, resembled classical statuary. To this she added
      rich, artisanal embroideries in gold, silver, black, and blue that were
      loaded with all creatures great and small (elephants, monkeys, snakes,
      spiders, beetles) and coded with symbols of life and death. To truly
      appreciate the significance, each dress would require a decryption manual.
      What’s clear is that they required tremendous effort. When a couture dress
      is described in quantitative terms as requiring 100-plus hours of
      embroidery, well, it’s hard to imagine that level of workmanship. Pei said
      today’s final dress took her seven years, all told. On and off, she
      returned to this self-contained, somewhat tomblike garden of tulle and
      embroidered flowers. As a summation of another characteristically opulent
      collection, it signaled both life and death—only this time as a vibrant
      expression in color.
