      Elie Saab has said à bientôt to Miss Havisham. Where his January Couture
      show drooped under the weight of heavy embellishments, this collection
      felt a bit lighter and—it follows—more modern. That's not to say that the
      designer has changed his look; there were still scads of beads and
      crystals, as befits the haute couture, and even strips of fur were used as
      accents. But Saab's diaphanous, fairy princess dresses felt of this Paris
      moment. He caught the feeling for the long-sleeved, slim gowns that we've
      seen elsewhere, opening with one in an icy gray-blue tulle that was draped
      and gathered at the waist and accented with metallic silver. Next up was a
      sleeveless full-length dress followed by a knee-skimming number in the
      same shade of aquamarine. Saab worked his methodical way through his
      palette. After a section in pale blue came white, then pink, mauve, and
      brown. He ended with a navy group and a single bride in platinum white. It
      seemed there was a backless dress in every color. Saab's old-fashioned,
      repetitive way of showing detracts from his precious workmanship. He's
      seen fit to upgrade the clothes themselves; now, perhaps it's time to
      update his presentations. He could start by kissing the wind machine
      good-bye.
