      Today was Jean Paul Gaultier's first time on the runway since shuttering
      his prêt-à-porter business with a shower of gold confetti last September.
      It was a new beginning of sorts, and to celebrate he chose weddings as his
      theme. Most couture shows have a single betrothed; JPG had a couple dozen
      of them. He dubbed the collection 61 Façons de Se Dire Oui, or 61 Ways to
      Say Yes. The bride wore a lace bomber and tulle ball skirt, the bride wore
      shorts, and the bride wore blue jeans. Naomi Campbell closed the show
      wrapped in cellophane and live orchids and not much else; she was a bridal
      bouquet. In the detailed show notes, each look got a clever name of its
      own. To Bi or Not to Bi, a little black number tailored like a man's suit
      on one side and draped like a dress on the other, was classic Gaultier.
      There were first-rate examples of his masculine-feminine hybrids from
      beginning to end, and they were the strongest elements of a show that also
      included python—both the real thing and an intricate burnished paillette
      facsimile—as well as a passage of evening numbers that exposed the satin
      boning of corsets and crinoline cages. The crowd was the rowdiest of
      couture week—this or any other. They cheered for even the silliest of
      looks—Lindsey Wixson's tutu overalls with beekeeper's hat takes that
      prize—and tossed the anemones left on each seat at Gaultier's favorite
      models from times gone by as they came down the elevated runway in their
      alterna-bride attire. Clothing-wise, we've seen much of this before, but
      Gaultier's shows are one of the last places in fashion where we're
      encouraged to have fun. For the time being, that's enough to keep everyone
      coming back.
