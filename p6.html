      For his latest haute couture collection, Alexis Mabille imagined how the
      scent of a woman would look. The multisensory idea gave him wide
      interpretative inspiration; for just as some people smell something and
      immediately envision a color (one aspect of the phenomenon known as
      synesthesia), he will tell you that this lineup of 20 soirée dresses
      grouped by color tones represent a wardrobe based on his interest in
      fragrance notes. Consider his creative pièce de résistance, a blouson
      blanketed in sculpted gold lamé flowers, studded with tiny jewels at their
      centers; this was his translation of bergamot, tonka, and opoponax—which
      as a perfume, would itself translate to something bright and citrusy yet
      also enveloping. The floral scents of geraniums and peonies informed the
      red creations, which included a decidedly dramatic velvet dress with
      voluminous sleeves lined in layers of pleated organza fading from red to
      pink. It gave off quite the bouquet. Whatever you make of the metallic
      grouping materializing from notes of ginger and verbena, the flounced and
      tiered lamé bustier dress and brocade coatdress both qualified as
      effervescent. By now, it’s worth asking: If you had neither background in
      fragrance composition, nor knowledge of Mabille’s subjective accords,
      could you still appreciate this collection? Most likely his faithful muses
      will be drawn to the pink dress with a crisscrossed neckline not because
      it is visually redolent of peonies, but because the silhouette strikes as
      flattering and original. Which leads to a follow-up question: Did the
      concept complicate the design? In a way, it kept Mabille more focused,
      even while he remained in his fantasy register of princess tulle and
      ever-present bows. It’s not a stretch to wonder whether this was a tease
      for an eau d’Alexis. Nothing imminent, he said. Incidentally, the
      presentation space was unscented, which was probably for the best. But
      while investigating his embroideries up close, one almost hoped to detect
      a faint sillage.
