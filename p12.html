      There are as many responses to the November attacks as there are designers
      in Paris. It’s all but inevitable the subject would come up this week;
      designers were working on their haute couture collections when the events
      occurred. Giambattista Valli’s idea was to look at the city’s famous
      gardens. “It’s kind of a thank-you to Paris,” he said backstage. “You know
      that flowers are my obsession. This time they come from the Parc de
      Bagatelle, the Jardin du Luxembourg, the Palais-Royal, and the Jardin des
      Tuileries.” The other ground-shifting event in Paris near that time, on a
      much smaller, less world consequential scale, of course, was Raf Simons’s
      abrupt departure from Dior. In fact, with the intense focus on flowers
      here, some saw a bid by Valli for the open creative director job at the
      LVMH house, flowers having been a preoccupation of Monsieur Dior’s, as
      well. Be that as it may, this was a signature Valli collection. Cue the
      short lengths, tailor-made for the leggy young ladies who decorated his
      front row. Cue the exaggerated volumes, this time focused on bishop
      sleeves, Watteau backs, and a handful of empire-waist gowns. (An
      exhibition of paintings featuring Napoleon’s sisters, Elisa, Pauline, and
      Caroline, proved inspirational.) And cue the by now trademark parade of
      tulle plissé grand finale gowns, the boldest and best in a pulsating shade
      of red poppy. Sparkle and sequin were downplayed here in favor of colorful
      embroideries and appliqués; when Valli did employ crystals, it was in
      grid-like patterns as precise as his flowers were flamboyant. As a rule,
      the fleurs were more persuasive. They came in many forms: picked out in
      paillettes on an organza empire-waist dress; as swirling garlands on
      short-in-front/long-in-back gowns of lace macramé; and, quite prettily,
      intarsia-ed in a rosebush motif on a short coat in white mink. Valli
      recently dressed first-time Oscar nominee Brie Larson. He was mum on the
      subject of the upcoming Academy Awards, but should her stylist be
      shopping, our vote goes to something in that red poppy hue.
