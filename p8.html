      There were almost as many sequins in the front row at Zuhair Murad as
      there were on the runway—proof, as if any were needed, of how loyal the
      designer’s fan base is. Some of them even wore tiaras. Although latter-day
      czarinas may be partial to head jewels, this collection, inspired by a
      night in imperial St. Petersburg, didn’t really need them. There was
      plenty of intricate jewel-like detailing going on in the clothes, some of
      it so elaborate the dresses rasped the floor. And yet, for such a
      profusion of opulence, this collection may just count among Murad’s more
      restrained outings. It looked more womanly than girly, for one. Or perhaps
      it’s because he decided to embellish rich fabrics like velvet, duchesse
      satin, and chiffon in a harmonious palette of wine, gray, sapphire, and
      (winningly) khaki, with mostly tonal arabesques or floral embroideries.
      “The czars and czarinas had famously luxurious taste,” the designer
      offered backstage before the show, although in lieu of a specific muse, he
      said he looked to his “many Russian clients who are beautiful and also
      have a very strong character.” The show notes name-checked Elizabeth of
      Russia, whose wardrobe counted 15,000 dresses and whose best-known legacy
      is the Winter Palace; Keira Knightley also got a nod for her title role in
      Anna Karenina (in 2013, the film won both the Oscar and the BAFTA for best
      costume design). Still, it’s worth noting that, like the rest of Europe,
      the aristocracy in imperial Russia was taking all its fashion cues from
      France. Murad incorporated military details on opening numbers, such as a
      black velvet suit and tails with bronze and red embroidery or a fully
      beaded, cropped double-breasted jacket over harem trousers, but those and
      several caped pieces aside, he didn’t seem to be caught in any single
      period. These 55 looks are clearly of the red carpet–and–Instagram era:
      Astonishing embellishments such as imperial eagles or messages of love
      embroidered in gold merited examination close up. Even the bride was a
      queen. Asked how many hours the embroidery might have taken, the designer
      replied, “Thousands and thousands. That’s another story.” The effect was
      cinematic, although a real-life bride would be wise to know what she’s
      getting into. “It’s a little bit heavy,” he admitted. “You need to be a
      strong woman to wear it.”
