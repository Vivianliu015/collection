      Luisa Beccaria has spent summer holidays in Capri since she was a child.
      “I know all the hidden charms of this quite magical place,” she said over
      the phone. Making her ties with the Blue Island even stronger, she
      recently opened a shop near its famous piazzetta; the couture collection
      is intended as a further homage to this place of the heart. Taking cue
      from Capri’s palette of natural hues— the blue of the sky and the sea; the
      pink of the sunsets over Faraglioni—romantic ballgowns were a triumph of
      undulating ruffles and fringes in raw-cut tulle, replicating the
      reflections on the moon on the water. Elsewhere, scrub flowers mimicking
      the many scented varieties bordering the Via Krupp’s verdant promenade
      were appliquéd in 3D on the bodice of ethereal numbers in chiffon. Most of
      the fabrications and embroideries were upcycled and reassembled from old
      collections, as Beccaria and her daughter Lucilla believe that their past
      repertoire is a trove for no-waste, responsible haute creations. Working
      with the traditional Caprese goldsmith Chanteclair, established on the
      island in 1947, the Beccarias designed delicate jewelry pieces in gold and
      precious stones, nicely complementing their dreamy concoctions. Luisa
      isn’t new to involving the island’s artisans in collaborations; she had
      her first fashion pieces—a few mohair jumpers and matching silk cropped
      capri pants, typical of the style of the island—made by Anacapri craftsmen
      when she was still a teenager. With international tourism slowly resuming,
      the Beccarias are confident that their beloved island will soon become a
      favorite destination again. The centuries-old culture of hospitality on
      Capri is legendary. “Foreigners were thought to be messengers of the gods,
      explorers of the unknown, and thus revered,” she explained. “It’s such a
      bewitching place, you don’t need to build ephemeral structures or launch
      preposterous events. The vibe here is naturally magnetic. I’ve never
      suffered from bad-mood syndrome when in Capri.”
